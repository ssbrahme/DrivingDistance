# DrivingDistance
Driving Distance Shiny app- using Google Distance Matrix API call  

Hi All!

This was my first attempt to create a web app with web development framework- Shiny.  
'Driving Distance' app calls Google Distnace Matrix API and outputs the answer in 'number of miles' to the user screen.  
Here is the link to the documentation of the API. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/

The web app is available here: https://sarang.shinyapps.io/distance

This is a little screen shot of the Driving Distance App with a representative example!
